### Hi, I'm Nick 👋

I'm an astrophysicist, currently at the [University of Oklahoma](https://nhn.ou.edu). My research interests pertain to the formation of the youngest protostars and I've done a [lot of work in this area.](https://nickalaskreynolds.github.io#projects) I am interested in open source projects (science and coding), software development, and learning new coding skills.
